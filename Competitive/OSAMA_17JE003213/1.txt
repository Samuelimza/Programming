A Graph is a collection of nodes and edges in any pattern to make all the different types of graphs.
Trees and DAGs are categories of graphs which have definite properties and have structure. For trees such as any
two nodes may have only one edge connecting them, each node (except the root node) has exactly one parent.
Whereas Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) contain directed edges such that there exists no path from a node 
that comes back to itself.
In a DAG a node may contain more than one parent but this is not the case in a tree.
