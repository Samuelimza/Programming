 # NeuroEvolutionary Self Driving Car
A self driving car equipped with a Neural Network that is evolved using a Genetic Algorithm.
This project is an implementation of Self Driving Simulated cars that use a Neural Network by providing the immediate sorrounding proximity as input and the output to guide them through the sorrounding.

## Requirements
To run you would require the [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
Or if you want to tweak the code while running you would require the [Processing integrated development environment](https://processing.org/download/)

## Usage
To execute go to the application folder and run GA2.exe. The applicatiion has a gui that is easy to use.

## Principle
When you first launch the application a random generation of cars will be generated. After simulating once the Genetic Algorithm (Read more: [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)) will kick in and apply genetic operators such as crossover, mutation etc, to give you another generation of cars derived from only the best ones in the previoius generation according to a fitness function that judges how well a car performs on the track.
